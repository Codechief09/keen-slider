## Contributing

If you find a bug or have ideas for better code, I would be grateful for your contribution. Just create an issue or a pull request.

## Sponsoring

This project is and remains open source. Currently, I'm working on a new major version, that includes "all" features requested and much more by nearly the same project size (80% completed). After that, I will add much more examples for other use cases and tech stacks.

Cause, I'm a family man with a full-time job I can't make any promises when the new version will be released. But I am highly motivated to make my vision of this project come true.

If you are interested in sponsoring, I would be very grateful. But you don't have to do that, especially not to motivate me to continue working on this project. I have the intention to continue anyway.
